# Sprint 1 End: 4/27/20

This sprint's milestone can be found [here](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/milestone/3).

We focused on tasks that would allow us to provide a `pre-release` branch for community developers to examine (issue [#27](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/27)). 

This mainly required the completion of issue [#26](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/26) which generates
a user's API Secret when they are added to the database in order for the developer to make requests to the submission endpoint.
This issue was completed and will be merged into dev as soon as we're done delivering the `pre-release` branch on 4/30/2020.

Other tasks included improving the JSON validation errors for end users and using Mongoose Schema for data operations. Work was
also done this sprint to write tests that evaluated the new JSON Schema and some of the code in the API.

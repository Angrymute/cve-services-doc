# Sprint 4 End: 6/8/20

This sprint was focused on using GraphQL for the CVE GET endpoint [#39](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/39) and establishing a CI pipeline for the project [#32](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/issues/32). Despite the holiday weekend in the middle of the sprint, progress was made on both issues. Changes are being made to the test suite to help ease their execution within our future CI pipeline and developers are studying GraphQL to learn how to properly use it within the codebase.

Both issues are rolling to the next sprint.

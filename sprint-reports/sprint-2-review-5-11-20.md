# Sprint 2 End: 5/11/20

In order to deploy ESUS (and the API as a whole) on the infrastructure planned, security review needs to start soon. To prepare, the development team spent time this sprint to review the code base. Several issues were created as a result to complete in Sprint 3.

A few minor issues were fixed during review, such as changing the error when an authentication header is missing to 400 Bad Request instead of 501 Unauthorized.

Another observation was made that if a user didn't exist in the system, they would technically pass the middleware validation! 

These bugs aren't shocking, as the focus of development has been on ESUS functionality and this code was the first pass on some user validation (User Registry) necessary to present an accurate representation of the ESUS interface. Now that eyes have turned to this code to build out the User Registry, issues are turning up.
